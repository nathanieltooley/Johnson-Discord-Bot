# Johnson-Discord-Bot
Personal discord.py bot, used on my friend's server. not to be used on any other servers.
Honestly, this is just setup for heroku auto-deploy but feel free to look at the code.

## Functions
Currently, this bot can do a number of things:

  * Allow you to play Rock Paper Scissors with an another discord user
  
  * Reply to keywords (thats always fun right?)
  
  * Keep track of a server currency, "V-Bucks," as well as server experience and your Level
  
  * Play blackjack and other basic forms of gambling
  
  * Basic Moderation
  
  * A cool dialogue system that I put too much time and effort into
